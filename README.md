# CustomerPersonalityAnalysis


Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company's different types of customers. It helps businesses to understand their customers and come up with the best sales and campaigns to serve them better. 
One example can be instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the database; it can analyze which segment is most likely to buy that product then market to them.
I will perform a clustering analysis on the customer’s Dataset. 
Dataset has 29 columns. The first Columns are about people and their income, education, and children, etc. Then the amounts of different types of product they bought. I will make one column from all and name it “totalMNT.”
And the 3rd part of the dataset is about the different types of purchases. I will make a total column for that as well. 
I uploaded the data in BigQuery for precleaning. I used the query below to make a new table and import it to a Jupyter notebook.
